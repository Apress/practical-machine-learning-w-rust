\section{Conclusion}%
This chapter introduced you to different algorithms for unsupervised learning such as Kmeans clustering, Gaussian Mixture models, DBSCAN models and Principal Component Analysis. We also took a look at how to create these models using \lstinline{rusty_machine} library. Finally you got to know about evaluating unsupervised models using rand index and jaccard index.

In the next chapter you will learn about working with data and how to create effective data pipelines in Rust.
